                                    As the world shifts away from fossil fuels towards green technologies for a low-carbon future,
                                    the demand for various metals is surging. The push for sustainability, particularly with the goal of complete
                                    electric vehicle adoption by 2050, is placing immense pressure on the supply chains of crucial metals.
                                    This growth is closely tied to the expansion of renewable energy and energy storage systems,
                                    where metals like aluminium, copper, steel, and construction steel play vital roles in generating, storing,
                                    and distributing sustainable energy from solar, wind, hydro and thermal sources.
                                    Additionally, zinc is gaining prominence as a battery material for energy storage at charging
                                    stations and smart energy grids. The exploration of large, stationary lead-acid batteries further contributes
                                    to stability and resilience in these systems. The escalating global demand for materials essential to the sustainable
                                    transition is impacting availability and prices.
                                    The London Metal Exchange (LME) plays a pivotal role in facilitating access
                                    to physical materials, offering hedging solutions, and providing price discovery. This unique positioning allows the LME to
                                    actively support the ongoing global economic shift towards sustainability.
